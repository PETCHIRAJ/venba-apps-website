## Project Overview

### Current Website Analysis
- **URL**: https://apps.venba.dev
- **Technology**: Astro-based static site
- **Primary App**: Privacy Expense Manager (Play Store)
- **Key Pages**: Home, Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, Data Deletion

### Design Goals
1. **Build Trust & Credibility**: Establish confidence for privacy-focused apps
2. **Modern Aesthetic**: Clean, contemporary design that appeals to mobile users
3. **Maintain Simplicity**: Respect solo developer's time constraints
4. **Legal Compliance**: Ensure privacy/terms pages meet Play Store requirements
5. **Optimize Conversions**: Improve app download rates

### Key Findings from Current Analysis

**Strengths:**
- Clean, minimalist foundation
- Clear information hierarchy

- Mobile-friendly layout
- Emphasizes privacy-first approach

**Critical Weaknesses:**
- Limited visual appeal (monochromatic palette)
- Weak call-to-action prominence
- Minimal visual differentiation between sections
- No trust signals or credibility elements
- Lacks engaging app showcasing

### Play Store Legal Page Requirements

- Content is accessible and readable
- Policy is available at an active URL
- Information is comprehensive and transparent
- Contact information is provided
- Last updated date is included

**Design Freedom**: Legal pages can follow custom design while maintaining readability and compliance.
