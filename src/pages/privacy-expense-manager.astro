        <h2>The Simple Truth</h2>
        <div class="privacy-feature">
            <p><strong>Your expenses stay on YOUR device. Period.</strong></p>
            <p>Privacy Expense Manager is built with one principle: your financial data is yours alone. We don't collect it, we don't see it, we don't want it.</p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>What We DON'T Collect</h2>
        <div class="no-collect">

        <h2>How Your Data is Protected</h2>
        <div class="privacy-feature">
            <h3>üîê Encrypted Local Storage</h3>
            <p>All your expense data is stored locally on your device using Android's secure storage system. It's encrypted and accessible only to you.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="privacy-feature">
            <h3>üì± Device-Only Access</h3>
            <p>Your data never leaves your device. There's no server, no cloud, no backend - just your phone and your data.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="privacy-feature">
            <h3>üîÑ Backup Control</h3>
            <p>You control your backups. Export your data as CSV or backup to your own Google Drive (Premium feature). We never see these backups.</p>
